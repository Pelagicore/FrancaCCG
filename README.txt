TEMP README

Use ./run.sh to generate stub and proxy for simpleFranca/simpleFranca.fidl.
Not usable with other Franca files at the moment (will get C compile errors with other files due to debug code)

Use ./cleanup.sh to return to pre-"run.sh" state.



KNOWN BUGS:
- codegen-francac does not handle multiple methods with the same name very well.
